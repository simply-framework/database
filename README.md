This package provides a partial database abstraction layer that is intended to make simple
database operations more convenient while being able to write consistent and structured
code with custom database queries. The purpose of this package is not to provide a complete
database abstraction and will require you to write quite a bit of database specific SQL
code still.

Therefore, this package is a database *convenience* layer rather than an abstraction layer,
as it simply makes things more convenient but does not abstract away the underlying database.

NOTE: This package is part of a framework that is still highly experimental in nature. Stable api or proper
documentation are not to be expected until the framework has been tested in practice.

API documentation is available at: https://docs.riimu.net/simply/database/
